h2. Installation

Loft is designed to be quickly thrown into a Django app when a client suddenly decides they need to blog. To install, do the following:

* Add @loft@ to your @INSTALLED_APPS@
* Add @(r'^loft/', include('loft.urls'))@ to your @urlpatterns@
* Run @./manage.py syncdb@ to create the database tables

You'll also need to create the following templates:

* entry_archive_month.html
* entry_archive_year.html
* entry_archive.html
* entry_archive_detail.html
* entry_list.html
